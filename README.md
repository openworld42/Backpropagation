# Backpropagation

Neural backpropagation (Java) with examples and training.

You can find java test/example programms in the 

[test directory](https://github.com/openworld42/Backpropagation/tree/main/src/test) of Github.

**TesterSimpleNumbers.java** is the most simple example, training a one-hidden-layer backpropagation 
network to approximate a result (number) from to input numbers.

### How to use it:
Download the newest Github release **backpropagation_vx.x.x.jar** file . Write your own neuronal network application or start
with one of the [test program examples](), referencing the jar like

**java -cp backpropagation_vx.x.x.jar**

where **x.x.x** is the current version. You need a Java runtime/JDK installed (at least version 17 - check on command line using **java -version**).<br/>
To get it: **Linux**: simply use your package manager, **Windows/macOS/others**: download and install JDK from [here](https://openjdk.java.net/).<br/> 
You may also build it from scratch using **Ant** and the **build.xml** file.<br/>

**Apache 2.0 licensed**, therefore may be used in any other project/program.
